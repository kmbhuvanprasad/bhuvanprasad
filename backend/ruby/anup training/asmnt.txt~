Object Oriented Programming

It refers to a programming language which make use of concepts of inheritance,classes,polymorphism and encapsulation to solve complex software applications

Classes

classes are user defined data types for data hiding i.e encapsulation and declaring data members i.e variables
eg:
class Class_name          (camel case for first letter of Class_name)
(methods are defined here)
end

methods

methods are similar to that of functions, they are defined before being called anywhere in the program
eg:
def methodname
 puts" "
end

Objects

objects are real world entity which have state(place where tasks are performed) and behaviour( different tasks that are performed)
eg:object=class_name.new
   object.methodname

*********************************************************************************
class Calendar
	def send_invite
		puts"send invite"
	end
end
class Response 
	def send_response
		puts"Response sent to Calender."
	end
end
#obj=Calendar.new
#obj.send_invite
obj1=Response.new
obj1.send_invite
obj1.send_response
************************************************************************
Encapsulation

hiding of data or tasks that are performed internally that are not visible 



class Mammal  # camel case
	def breathe
		puts "inhale and exhale"
	end
end

class Whale < Mammal
	def big
		puts "we make sound"
	end
end

object1=Mammal.new
object1.breathe
object=Whale.new
object.breathe
object.big
